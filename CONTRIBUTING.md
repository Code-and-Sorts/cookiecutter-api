## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the README should be updated. Add the feature to the list in README.md.

3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. Check https://github.com/Code-and-Sorts/cookiecutter-api/pull_requests and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Add a New Test

When fixing a bug or adding features, it's good practice to add a test to demonstrate your fix or new feature behaves as expected. These tests should focus on one tiny bit of functionality and prove changes are correct.
